### Simple and Useful To-Do-List App using React Js

- Created the app in order to learn, practice and get familiar with React Js.

- Components used:
  - Todos.js for the list of todoitems stored in the app.
  - TodoItem.js for the actual list items for the todolist.
  - AddTodo.js for adding the input text field with a submit button to add todolist items in our list of todo.

- Folder: ./layout and created the Header.js file in it for the header component of the app.

- Folder: ./pages in which created About.js for basic info about our app using react-router-dom module.

- Feel free to use the code. Happy Coding.
